# Glossary of AWS Terms

This glossary provides definitions for key AWS terms used throughout the workshop.

- **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**: A pre-configured template for EC2 instances that contains the software configuration (operating system, application server, and applications) required to launch an instance.

- **Auto Scaling**: A feature that automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group according to conditions you define.

- **Availability Zone (AZ)**: One or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity in an AWS Region.

- **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**: A comprehensive, evolving cloud computing platform provided by Amazon.

- **AWS CLI (Command Line Interface)**: A unified tool to manage your AWS services from the command line.

- **AWS Management Console**: A web application for managing Amazon Web Services.

- **CDK (Cloud Development Kit)**: An open-source software development framework to define cloud infrastructure in code and provision it through AWS CloudFormation.

- **CloudFormation**: A service that helps you model and set up your AWS resources so you can spend less time managing those resources and more time focusing on your applications that run in AWS.

- **CloudWatch**: A monitoring and observability service built for DevOps engineers, developers, site reliability engineers (SREs), and IT managers.

- **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: A web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

- **Elastic IP**: A static IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing.

- **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**: A web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources.

- **Internet Gateway**: A horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet.

- **NAT Gateway**: A Network Address Translation (NAT) service that allows instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services, but prevents the internet from initiating a connection with those instances.

- **RDS (Relational Database Service)**: A web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud.

- **Region**: A physical location around the world where AWS clusters data centers.

- **Route Table**: A set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic is directed.

- **S3 (Simple Storage Service)**: An object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.

- **Secrets Manager**: A service that helps you protect access to your applications, services, and IT resources.

- **Security Group**: A virtual firewall for your EC2 instances to control incoming and outgoing traffic.

- **Subnet**: A range of IP addresses in your VPC.

- **Systems Manager**: A service that gives you visibility and control of your infrastructure on AWS.

- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: A service that lets you launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network that you define.

- **VPC Endpoint**: Enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by AWS PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection.

- **VPC Peering**: A networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses.
