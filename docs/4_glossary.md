- **Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: A service that lets you launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network that you define.

- **Auto Scaling**: A feature that automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group according to conditions you define.

- **Availability Zone (AZ)**: One or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity in an AWS Region.

- **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**: A comprehensive, evolving cloud computing platform provided by Amazon.

- **AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit)**: An open-source software development framework to define cloud infrastructure in code and provision it through AWS CloudFormation.

- **AWS CLI (Command Line Interface)**: A unified tool to manage your AWS services from the command line.

- **AWS CloudFormation**: A service that helps you model and set up your AWS resources so you can spend less time managing those resources and more time focusing on your applications that run in AWS.

- **AWS Config**: A service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources.

- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: A service for deploying and scaling web applications and services.

- **AWS Global Accelerator**: A networking service that improves the availability and performance of applications.

- **AWS Lambda**: AWS's serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.

- **AWS Management Console**: A web application for managing Amazon Web Services.

- **AWS Organizations**: A service for consolidating multiple AWS accounts into an organization that you create and centrally manage.

- **AWS Trusted Advisor**: An online tool that provides real-time guidance to help you provision your resources following AWS best practices.

- **Edge Locations**: Sites that CloudFront uses to cache copies of your content for faster delivery to users.

- **Elastic IP**: A static IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing.

- **Elastic Load Balancing**: A service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses.

- **Internet Gateway**: A horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet.

- **Multi-AZ Deployment**: A feature of services like RDS that provides enhanced availability and durability.

- **NAT Gateway**: A Network Address Translation (NAT) service that allows instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services, but prevents the internet from initiating a connection with those instances.

- **Parameter Groups**: Used in RDS to manage database engine configuration.

- **Read Replicas**: Database replicas that can be used to increase read performance.

- **Region**: A physical location around the world where AWS clusters data centers.

- **Route Table**: A set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic is directed.

- **Savings Plans**: A flexible pricing model that provides savings on AWS compute usage.

- **AWS Secrets Manager**: A service that helps you protect access to your applications, services, and IT resources.

- **Security Group**: A virtual firewall for your EC2 instances to control incoming and outgoing traffic.

- **Spot Instances**: Unused EC2 capacity that's available for less than the On-Demand price.

- **Subnet**: A range of IP addresses in your VPC.

- **SSM (Systems Manager) Session Manager**: A fully managed AWS Systems Manager capability that lets you manage your EC2 instances through an interactive one-click browser-based shell or through the AWS CLI.

- **VPC Endpoint**: Enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by AWS PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection.

- **VPC Peering**: A networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses.
